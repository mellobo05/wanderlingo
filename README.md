2. Add your API keys:
   - **Google Translate**: Get free API key from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
   - **Azure Translator**: Get key from [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
   - **LibreTranslate**: Free, no key needed (default)

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your keys
VITE_GOOGLE_TRANSLATE_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### Traveler Mode Usage

1. **Click "üåç Traveler Mode"** in the header
2. **Select your destination language** (e.g., Vietnamese for Vietnam)
3. **Choose your situation** (greeting, directions, food, etc.)

### Notes
- No server or persistence; library is in-memory only
- Chrome AI APIs are experimental and may not be available; the app degrades to heuristic simplification
- Translation works without API keys (uses fallback), but real APIs provide better quality
- Voice features require microphone access and work best in Chrome/Edge browsers
- Traveler Mode includes 50+ languages with Vietnamese, Thai, Indonesian, and other popular travel destinations
